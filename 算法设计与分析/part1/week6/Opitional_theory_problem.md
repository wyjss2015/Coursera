##1. Recall that a set H of hash functions (mapping the elements of a universe U to the buckets {0,1,2,…,n−1}) is universal if for every distinct x,y∈U, the probability Prob[h(x)=h(y)] that x and y collide, assuming that the hash function h is chosen uniformly at random from H, is at most 1/n. In this problem you will prove that a collision probability of 1/n is essentially the best possible. Precisely, suppose that H is a family of hash functions mapping U to {0,1,2,…,n−1}, as above. Show that there must be a pair x,y∈U of distinct elements such that, if h is chosen uniformly at random from H, then Prob[h(x)=h(y)]≥1n−1|U|.
